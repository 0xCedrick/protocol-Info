| PTIP-9: Tether Prize Pool & Helping Small Fish | Product | [Discuss](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/ptip-9-tether-prize-pool-helping-small-fish/936) |

Summary:\
This proposal aims to change the drip rate on UNI and COMP prize pools. Implement two new drips for Tether prize pool, one for deposits and one for sponsorship.
It proposes incentivizing the new no loss Tether prize pool with 400 POOL per day. Spliting that incentive 80 / 20 between sponsorship and deposits.
Reducing distribution on the UNI and COMP pools from 255 per day to 50 per day

Update:
[Calls](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/ptip-9-tether-prize-pool-helping-small-fish/936/10) to implement this on ethereum as "the timeline for Polygon was too short to make the needed UI updates"
