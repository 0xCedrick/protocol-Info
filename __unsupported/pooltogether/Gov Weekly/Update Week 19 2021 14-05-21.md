| “The Fish Tank” / Fair win chances for little balances | Product | [Discuss](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/the-fish-tank-fair-win-chances-for-little-balances/627) |

Summary:\
This post addresses concern with whales winning most prizes.
It proposes a feature called "The Fish Tank", whereby a percentage of the interest is put aside to fill another prize pool, which is not correlated to the number of tickets, but only to the addresses who enter.

Update: \
[Pushback](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/the-fish-tank-fair-win-chances-for-little-balances/627/6) given that the "PoolPower Pods" coming soon may well address this problem.

Update 2: \
Discussion [linked](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/the-fish-tank-fair-win-chances-for-little-balances/627/17) to another [proposal](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/pooltogether-jackpots/229) suggesting that instead of redistributing that % cut every week, it could accumulate to a really massive prize that is 1) really lifechanging and 2) attracts media attention
