| Quickswap Mining with POOL/Quick | Treasury | [Discuss](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/quickswap-mining-with-pool-quick/1062) |

Summary:\
Discussion advocates that the PoolTogether treasury allocate approximately $250k in POOl tokens and $250K in USDC from PTIP-13(Assuming it passes) to seed a liquidity pool on Quickswap. The USDC would need to be swapped to QUICK on polygon to create the LP token pair of POOL/QUICK.

Update:
Amonghst ample support, [questions](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/quickswap-mining-with-pool-quick/1062/7) as to whether with SushiSwap now being on Polygon and them doing a really large campaign with Matic rewards if that might be a better spot for us?

Summary:\
Open discussion regarding best strategy for reserve rates. Primarily advocates that community should lower reserve rates to optimize for larger prize sizes in the early stages of protocol growth

Update:
[Pushback](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/reserve-rates/1110/14)
arguing that reserve rates should not be changed and instead community should (1) Continue to work on ways to help small depositors win (pods should be a big help here) and (2) Continue the discussion on more interesting ways to use the proceeds from the reserve
