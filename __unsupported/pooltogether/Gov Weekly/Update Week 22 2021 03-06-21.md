| PTIP-19 Drip 50 POOL/day to LINK Pool. Turn reserve rate to 50% | Product | [Discuss](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/ptip-19-drip-50-pool-day-to-link-pool-turn-reserve-rate-to-50/1169) |

Summary:\
Proposal to to drip 50 POOL/day to the LINK prize pool for a total of ten weeks. This would require a total of 3500 POOL from the treasury.

| PTIP-18 Use USDC in treasury to earn yield for the PoolTogether protocol | Treasury | [Discuss](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/ptip-18-use-usdc-in-treasury-to-earn-yield-for-the-pooltogether-protocol/1152) |

Summary:\
Proposal to take $2,000,000 of USDC from the treasury and deploy it on the Rari Capital Stable Pool for a period of one year.

This is a relatively safe, and simple way to increase the value of the PoolTogether treasury passively over time.
