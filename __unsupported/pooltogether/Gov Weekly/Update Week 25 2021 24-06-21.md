| PTIP-23: Add a Poolside Bar | Treasury/Tokenomics | [Discuss](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/ptip-23-add-the-poolside-bar/1258) |

Summary:\
This PTIP would do three things: (1) Apply half of the current 50% reserve rate from all governance pools to a buyback of POOL tokens which is then dripped to the POOL pool. (25% of total interest accrued by each pool) (2) Turn off the current POOL drip to the POOL pool as it will be replaced by the buyback.

| PTIP-24: Revised saving the little fish (phase 1) | Strategy/Product | [Discuss](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/ptip-24-revised-saving-the-little-fish-phase-1/1262) |

Summary:\
This PTIP would do three things: (1) Increase the number of weekly winners to the following Dai Prize Pool from 3 to 5 winners (2) Instead of giving all the accrued COMP to the “grand prize” winner, split the accrued COMP among all winners equally for all prize pools (Dai, USDC, COMP, UNI) (3) Stop the 200 POOL weekly prize and instead distribute that as increased APR to POOL stakers

This proposal is a revision of [PTIP-22](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/ptip-22-operation-10x-saving-the-little-fishes-phase-1/1250/4)
