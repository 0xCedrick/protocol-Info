| PTIP-23: Add a Poolside Bar | Treasury/Tokenomics | [Discuss](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/ptip-23-add-the-poolside-bar/1258) |

Summary:\
This PTIP would do three things: (1) Apply half of the current 50% reserve rate from all governance pools to a buyback of POOL tokens which is then dripped to the POOL pool. (25% of total interest accrued by each pool) (2) Turn off the current POOL drip to the POOL pool as it will be replaced by the buyback.

Update: [Arguments](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/ptip-23-add-the-poolside-bar/1258/7) that it is too early for such a proposal and efforts should first be directed elsewhere.
