**CGCI-LV:** The Coinshares Gold and Cryptoassets Index Lite Version is based upon the original EU Benchmark Index that was launched by the Coinshares Group in 2020 that includes ERC-20 tokens to be compatible in a tokenized index smart contract. CGCI-LV was developed to be a low-volatility index that integrates volatility harvesting through both forming a basket of cryptoassets and combining it with gold using a weighted-risk contribution similar to a rebalancing mechanism.

**FLI:** Flexible Leverage Index lets you leverage a collateralized debt without having to manage a collateralized debt, by abstracting collateralized debt management into a simple index, reproducible by an ERC20 token built on Set Protocol. 

**FLI Value:** Flexible Leverage Index makes leverage effortless and with FLI there is zero slippage because of composable entry and exit, the unique Index algorithm reduces rebalancing needs by an order of magnitude, and emergency deleveraging is possible during Black Swan events for additional fund safety
